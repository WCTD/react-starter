# React Starter Kit for We Connect The Dots Codeathons

This repository contains the basic repository for React apps used by the We Connect the Dots Codeathons. The initial configuration was created using `npx create-react-app .`, and uses a good portion of the default "app.js" template but with the following changes:

* Bootstrap and `reactstrap` are added to allow for simple theming
* `react-router-dom` is added to enable hash-based URL routing
* Two basic routes are already added (the index page and the about page)
* Deployment to Github Pages is supported via `npm run deploy`
